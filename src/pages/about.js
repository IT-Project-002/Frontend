          Our website is a welcoming community for anyone who wants to share,
          post or sell their little things. While browsing our website, you may
          find someone&apos;s handmade ceramic mugs, an artist&apos;s hand sketches, or
          even an old gentleman&apos;s favourite old story books! We are here to
          support people with creativity with their little business, as well as
          to provide a platform for people to sell the things that no longer
          needed but too good to be thrown away.

          Nowadays, everything is always fast-paced and commercial. Our team
          would like to encourage people to slow down a bit while using our
          website - in here, you can discover someone&apos;s magical thoughts through
          their handicrafts, you may got a chance to hear a good old memory from
          a stranger, or simply, you can chill on our website and have a fun
          time browsing unique items that don&apos;t follow a certain formula.{' '}
