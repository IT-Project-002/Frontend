          Our website is a welcoming community for anyone who wants to share,
          post or sell their little things. While browsing our website, you may
          find someone&apos;s handmade ceramic mugs, an artist&apos;s hand sketches, or
          even an old gentleman&apos;s favourite old story books! We are here to
          support people with creativity with their little business, as well as
          to provide a platform for people to sell the things that no longer
          needed but too good to be thrown away.
